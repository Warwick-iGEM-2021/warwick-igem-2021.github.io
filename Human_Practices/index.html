                Over the course of the last 10 months, we contacted health professionals, academics and engaged with the general public, to receive feedback we could use to adapt and improve our project. Human practices have been essential for us as a team throughout the project, allowing us to design our initial project idea, giving us new ideas about the ways we can improve public awareness of CRE, and continually change things, e.g. the model, as a result of receiving second opinions from academics.

<p>The original idea was to modify a disinfectant spray that would cause bacteria
on a surface to fluoresce is they were resistant to the disinfectant. As a
result, we contacted and held a meeting with Dr Richard Hastings, the Healthcare
Regulatory and Technical Manager at <a href="https://www.mirius.com/">Mirius</a>, a company
producing disinfectants and other cleaning solutions. Following this discussion,
we decided that a swab-based approach would be preferred over a spray-based one.
The main reason was that the concentration of our product, when sprayed onto a
large surface, would be unknown and would vary widely. This would lead to
varying and unreliable results. Additionally, if we were to integrate our
product into a disinfectant spray, there was a high risk that the strong
chemicals used in the spray would degrade the proteins and other components that
were essential for our system to work. Therefore, we decided to adapt our
project to a swab-based approach, which would be more consistent and therefore
reliable. After researching and discussing this new approach at one of our
weekly meetings, we decided the idea could be further improved upon. Instead of
testing for disinfectant resistance, we would test for antibiotic resistance, as
this was a much larger issue, and our project could make a greater impact.</p>
<p>As a result, we spoke to a hospital-based geriatrician as a preliminary,
non-compulsory scoping exercise to find out some rudimentary opinions. We found
out that <em>E. coli</em> and pneumococcus infections are the most common infections
that they encounter and lead to a lot of problems. We also spoke to an ITU
consultant, who told us a similar story with pneumococcus and Gram-negative
infections causing the most issues. As a result, our initial thought was to
target <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. However, this meant we would have had to work
in a category 2 laboratory, which would have been difficult to achieve under
iGEM safety guidelines. Therefore, following the feedback from our preliminary
research, it was suggested that we work with Gram-negative infection (<em>E. coli</em>)
instead, as we could do this in a category 1 laboratory. When researching <em>E.
coli</em>, we came across CRE as a major issue in a recently published
<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/923385/Framework_of_actions_to_contain_CPE.pdf">Public Health England report</a>.
This report made us decide that our project should be centred around CRE
detection.</p>
<p>Following this decision, we went back to ask what we could do to help the
situation regarding CRE. Both the ITU consultant and the hospital-based
geriatrician we were in contact with suggested that better infection control
procedures and teams in hospitals would make the biggest difference. They also
told us that amongst all the infections they encountered, approximately 20% of
them were hospital acquired infections, an alarmingly high statistic. An A&amp;E
nurse informed us hospitals now routinely swab every patient on admission for
CRE, but they did not know how long the results take. Subsequent research into
this told us that lab results take several days to return a positive result.
This exposes hospitals to the risk of potentially unchecked spread of CRE in the
meantime. As a direct result, a rapid detection method would help allow
infection control procedures, like isolation, to be implemented faster. We also
hoped that an easy to carry out test, would encourage infection control teams to
be more diligent in swabbing for CRE outside of just in A&amp;E departments. As a
result, this method would tackle the previously identified problem with
infection control procedures and help decrease hospital acquired infections in
general, which we later showed through <a href="../Model">our computational modelling</a>. As
a result, a rapid and easy to use detection method became our goal.</p>

<p>The next stage was to figure out how this rapid detection method would work. We
spoke with Dr Freya Harrison, a specialist on Carbapenem resistance, who advised
us to look at using phages or peptidoglycan layer tagging. She also taught us a
lot about the infectious dose and issues surrounding biofilms. As a result of
this meeting, we contacted and met with Dr Antonia Sagona, a phage therapy
specialist, about the possibility of using phages in our project. We discovered
that this would be too specific for our liking, as it would only allow us to
detect one strain of Carbapenem resistant bacteria, which would be of limited
use in a hospital. Therefore, we decided to avoid using phages to create our
rapid detection method. You can view more detailed information about these
meetings on <a href="../Planning">the planning page of our wiki</a>.</p>
<p>While we originally considered designing a faster way of diagnosing CRE in
patients, we encountered two problems. After speaking to a palliative medicine
consultant and an orthopaedic surgeon, we found out that hospitals nearly always
already know what bacteria they are treating. What they do not know is whether
said bacteria is resistant to any particular antibiotics. This makes diagnosing
CRE as simply an <em>E. coli</em> infection generally an unnecessary task. Therefore, we
decided trying to diagnose a bacteria’s level of resistance would be more
useful. However, during a meeting with Dr Richard Hastings later that month, he
informed us that there are many legal restrictions and regulations surrounding
the use of biological products on humans. That meant it would be difficult to
design a rapid detection method to diagnose human patients with CRE. It would
also take much longer to theoretically get it approved and certified for use in
hospitals. As a result, we looked at other ways to detect CRE.</p>
<div class="text-center">

        <p class="hugo-figure-caption">A photo of our meeting with Richard Hastings</p>
    
</div>

<p>Following Dr Hastings’ advice, we decided that containing the spread of CRE by
targeting reservoirs like sinks and faucets would have a bigger impact and be
more achievable. This would work to prevent multiple patients from becoming
infected in the first place rather than just diagnosing one patient&rsquo;s specific
stage of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, regulations around surface testing
are far more relaxed and require far less time to be tested and approved,
leading to an earlier potential deployment of our product. As a result, we
designed our product to be used to test surfaces. This would seamlessly
integrate into current procedures, as any swabs already taken for CRE can also
be used with our device. Furthermore, adapting our product for direct patient
testing in the future would be technically easy. While patient testing is not
the direct focus of our product, we consider it something possibly worth
exploring in the future.</p>
<p>Another important consideration was the safety of the contents of our testing
kit, to ensure regulatory compliance. After our meeting with Dr Hastings, we
were inclined to look further into regulations, to ensure our final product was
viable. These inquiries made us realise the use of malachite green as a
fluorescence indicator, a strong irritant, in our testing kit was a potential
issue. Therefore, we further adapted our product by using a combination of
iSpinach, a safer RNA, and harmless fluorophore called DFHBI for the same
purpose. The use of living cells in our testing kit also proved a problem. An
orthopaedic surgeon we contacted informed us that the risk of contamination
meant our product would possibly not get approval for use in hospitals. This led
us to investigate the possibility of designing a cell-free system, where living
cells would be lysed. Our goal was to design the final product such that it
would only contain the necessary components from those cells, with no risk of
contamination. In these ways, safety and adherence to regulations were central
to the development process.</p>

<p>Considering the feedback from the orthopaedic surgeon and embracing the idea
that an easy-to-use test would be most effective, we began to design how our
cell-free product would work. We created a prototype for this product’s
container, which consisted of a swab, one large reaction tube and two small
tubes containing solution 1 and solution 2. A swab would be taken of a surface
and placed into the large test tube, where solution 1 could then be added to
lyse the cells. Solution 2 would be added after, which, using our engineered
CRISPR system, would detect the presence of our target RNA transcribed from the
OXA-48 Carbapenem resistance gene. Therefore, if the bacteria present on the
swab are resistant to Carbapenems, then the tube will glow green when
illuminated by UV light, a very distinct and easy to recognise signal. More
information on our designed test kit can be found on <a href="../Implementation">the implementation page on our wiki</a>.</p>

<p>In September we designed a survey to assess how aware the general public were of
CRE. After gaining ethical approval, the survey was created using Qualtrics and
distributed both via email to all SLS undergraduate students at the University
of Warwick and via our official Warwick iGEM Instagram and Twitter pages. The
survey contained 4 questions, as you can see below.</p>

<p>We managed to obtain 508 responses from a large range of ages, meaning the
results should be relatively representative.</p>

<p>In response to the first question, we found that the majority of the public
(91%) were aware that some bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. While this
seemed to be relatively common knowledge, when asked about CRE in particular,
only 14% had heard of it before participating in our survey.</p>

<p>When split by age, we found that &gt;64s were the most likely to be unaware of CRE,
as only 8.45% of those who answered the survey had heard of it before. Those
aged between 25 – 34 were marginally more likely to be aware of CRE, but
generally there was no particular subset of the population that was
overwhelmingly more aware of it. The majority of participants from all ages had
not heard of the infection before.</p>

        <p class="hugo-figure-caption">A table showing the age breakdown of whether people are aware of CRE</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, we looked at the subset of the population who had heard of CRE before
participating in our survey and discovered that they were most likely to be
aware of it due to their job (37.8%). However, young people aged between 18 and
24 were the least likely to have heard of it this way, as only 7.4% of them
selected this option. Most frequently, they had heard of it through
University/High School education (40%) and/or scientific literature (18.5%).
Participants were least likely to have heard of CRE for the first time from NHS
resources, suggesting that there are not many resources out there to help
educate the public on this illness. Only those studying a specific degree or in
a particular job were likely to be aware of it, which is not representative of
the general public.</p>
<div class="text-center">

<p>Therefore, since only 14% of the public knew what CRE was, we designed and
distributed educational materials to raise awareness of CRE and inform people of
how our project might make an impact on the spread of this disease. For example,
we created this poster to provide an introduction into what CRE is, how we can
detect it, and how to reduce its spread, as we have seen that NHS resources are
not adequate for accomplishing this task.</p>

<p>During this time, we were developing a model to try to show how effective our
solution could be if deployed. However, up until this point the model did not
show our product having much of an effect on the outcome of our simulations.
There seemed to be little change in the number of patients who acquired
pathogens resistant to Carbapenems or patients that died. This was due to a
fault in the logic in the initial design of the model. The issue was that the
model put people into isolation if they were being treated with Carbapenems.
However, that implies the hospital does not believe the patient can be resistant
against Carbapenems, as then Carbapenem treatment would be ineffective. This was
therefore not only unrealistic (only Carbapenem resistance should have been
identified as an issue worthy notable enough to require isolation), but meant
our product was barely useful. The product only detects people with Carbapenem
resistance, which requires a patient to be treated with Carbapenems for it to
develop. Therefore, the product had little effect, as almost everyone it could
identify was already in isolation.</p>
<p>As a result, we reached out to Dr Alexander Darlington, who suggested that we
include an additional last-resort drug (e.g. Colistin), which would allow
patients treated with Colistin to be placed into isolation rather than those
treated with Carbapenems. Therefore, we adapted the model and made the
appropriate changes, meaning a more realistic number of people were put into
isolation while allowing our product to be useful. You can view the final model
<a href="../Model">on the model page of our Wiki</a></p>

<p>We hope that our project will be used in the future to not only reduce the
spread of CRE in hospitals, but also all hospital acquired infections in
general. We designed our system is easily adaptable to different types of
antibiotic resistant bacteria (e.g., pneumococcus, which we wanted to target but
couldn’t), by simply changing the gRNA to target a different gene. We also hope
that our system might be able to be used to directly diagnose patients with CRE
so they can receive the correct treatment as fast as possible to reduce the
severity of the disease and the risk of death. We have designed a prototype for
our rapid test kit, and hope that this will be adopted by hospitals in the
future to help detect CRE on surfaces or in patients, depending on what happens
with the technology we have designed.</p>
