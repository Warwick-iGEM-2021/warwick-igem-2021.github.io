<p>We tried to transform the SAJ-351 cells with the 379 plasmids.
The 379 plasmid contained resistance to kanamycin (Kan), so if the culture grew
on the Kan/Spec/Chlor plate then we would know the transformation had been
successful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no growth, so the transformation was
unsuccessful. However, the culture grew on the control plate without kanamycin,
so the cells were not killed in the procedure and the error lied with either the
transformation procedure, the concentration of the 379 plasmids, the competence
of the cells or the 379 plasmid itself.</p>

<p>The control grew, but the transformants didn’t. Therefore we made more competent cells from our existing culture, but we forgot to add antibiotics so the procedure didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>We tried the transformation again but received the same
results (no growth). As we had carefully followed the procedures for both transformation and
competence, we decided the most likely cause for the lack of growth on the
Kan/Spec/Chlor plate was either the 379 plasmid itself or the concentration of
the 379 plasmids, as it was very low. Therefore, we re-did the 379 plasmid
miniprep and received a concentration of 40.7 ng/µl.</p>

<p>We also ran a restriction digest on the 379 plasmids to see whether there were
any unexpected results. The results were inconclusive – after running the gel
for an additional 40 minutes on top of the required 40 minutes in the procedure,
there was still no visible ladder. We ran the gel again for another 20 minutes,
but unfortunately the agarose melted which meant we had to try again another
day.</p>

<p>We repeated the restriction digest and it appears that it may have
worked as we had somewhat of a visible ladder, but the integrity of the gel was
weak, and it broke easily so we were not convinced of the results and planned to
run it for a third time in the future.</p>

using the new miniprep of 379 plasmid. On the same day, we carried out yet another

case the transformation failed again.</p>

<p>However, the transformation was a success, creating a cell line which we called
PAJ! A single colony grew on the Kan/Spec/Chlor plate, meaning it contained the
plasmid with the kanamycin resistance gene. The success
of the transformation meant we did not need to repeat the restriction digest of
the 379 plasmid.</p>

obtain proof of concept. However, we did not have time, which is a shame but we
