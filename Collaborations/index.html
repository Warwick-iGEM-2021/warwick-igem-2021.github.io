                As part of our project, we wanted to develop relationships with a range of different iGEM teams in order to learn from each other and to form a community in a virtual manner. By using social media, participating in virtual meetups as well involving teams in our education Collaborative booklet we were able to learn from each other and gain useful insights in how to improve our project and how to find solutions to issues we were facing.

<p>iGEM Warwick had the opportunity to be involved in iGEM McMaster’s song project,
which involved our team members submitting audio of them singing synthetic
biology lyrics. This was part of a project to create a song meant to teach
younger students in an unconventional manner about biology, synthetic biology
and iGEM.</p>

<p><em>June 2021</em></p>
</div>
<div class="timeline-content">

<p>iGEM KCL invited us to attend a virtual meetup with a range of UK and Ireland
iGEM teams in June 2021. This was an informal meetup where we were able to meet
a range of different teams and discuss more about our project ideas and plans.
We presented a short 3 minute video on what our project will be to the teams in
our introduction then attended breakout rooms with different teams to work
together to help each other find solutions to problems arising and to share the
work we have done so far.</p>

</div>
<div class="timeline-content">

<p>While creating our collaborative outreach Magazine, iGEM Mingdao team submitted
their project information for it to be added to our booklet. From reading about
their project, we saw similarities with ours, such as how we are both creating
detection kits for dangerous bacteria. Therefore, iGEM Warwick wanted to learn
more about their project, in particular their human practices and wet lab work.
iGEM Warwick planned a virtual meeting with the team in August 2021 where we
introduced our projects, shared a video introducing our project as well
discussed the wet lab and human practices work we had done. We discussed
potential problems and solutions, such as the idea of working with
bacteriophages and who to contact for human practices. The meetup was extremely
informative and a fantastic way to get to know another team working on a similar
project.</p>

<p>On the 27th August iGEM Manchester organised a “code-a-thon”, where teams
programmed for 24 consecutive hours in order to make progress on their wikis.
There were check-in meetings every three hours, so we could have a chat and
discuss what we had achieved. It was a wonderful experience, with strong
camaraderie amongst the teams, not least during meetings later into the night.
Additionally, teams were able to help each other out with technical issues, for
example asking if anyone knew how to debug or fix an issue they had been
experiencing. Since two of our team members already have experience with web
design, we were able to help other teams. Especially JavaScript was a hot topic,
as this was a new experience for many of the more traditional iGEM team members
with backgrounds in biology!</p>
