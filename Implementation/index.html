                        We designed our product with usability in mind – therefore its finished form would take the form of a tube with a cell-free solution swabs can be submerged into. The solution would contain all the necessary components to produce the fluorescent reporter without containing any living cells, eliminating the risk of contamination. Should the kit be successful, iterating on it to detect different genes would be trivial, as only the sensing portion of our cgRNA would need to be changed to complement the mRNA of interest.

                    <h2 id="the-rationale">The rationale</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, this kit is aimed at use by hospital staff with minimal
training, in order to contain the spread of CRE more effectively. Healthcare
professionals have let us know that patients are routinely swabbed for various
types of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including CRE, and we believe that our
tool would complement this perfectly, providing more information for virtually
no drawbacks.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance has caused an arms race humanity is doomed to lose unless
more types of action aside from the discovery of novel antibiotics are taken,
raising a number of worrying questions about the future of healthcare.
Mitigating the effect that the spread of antibiotic resistance has is even more
important than it normally would be due to the COVID-19 pandemic placing
significant strain upon healthcare systems. Coinfection of COVID patients with
hospital bacteria has been known to happen, and thus we believe that a quick and
reliable diagnosis tool such as our detector can prevent at least some of these
from occurring.</p>
<h2 id="the-kit">The kit</h2>
<p>Our circuit was originally designed to also function in vitro - making it work
in a cell-free context would, in our opinion, not be particularly difficult. The
kit itself would take the form of a tube, filled with a cell-free extract which
would contain our engineered components, as well as the necessary substances to
produce the reporter, such as nucleotides, the buffers necessary for the RNA
aptamer’s correct folding and the fluorophore, DFHBI. Due to the non-toxic
nature of all the components and the absence of any living cells within the
tube, it would be perfectly safe for use with minimal personal protective
equipment. It would, however, need to be stored at low temperatures in order to
keep the proteins in the extract (such as dCas9) functional for an extended
period of time.</p>
<p>The kit’s use would be perfectly integrated into current procedures – after the
patient has been swabbed once and the initial sample sent for sequencing, a
second swab can be taken and placed into the tube. After a relatively short time
spent waiting, the solution can be examined for fluorescence and appropriate
measures taken, with their extension dependent upon the results of the
sequencing analysis. This would enable positive patients to be quarantined
earlier and limit the spread of CRE, as well as preventing the unnecessary
quarantine of patients who are suspected of carrying CRE but turn up not
carrying the bacteria. Other suspected reservoirs can also be tested very
easily, including sinks, drains and faucets. Moreover, the kit was designed for
simplicity of use. It includes a set of 4 step illustrated instructions, clearly
labelled reagents, a testube rack and a distinct signal for a positive test.
This means that to carry out a test the personnel only need to be trained in
swabbing patients. This also means that should the target organisation want to
deploy this kit in a more extensive format, for example routine swabbing of
surfaces, it will require little training for any personnel in the organisation
to carry out a test. The container of the kit and the testube rack are all made
exclusively from cardboard which is widely recyclable, this is in the aim to
minimise any environmental damage from a possible widespread deployment of these
kits.</p>

<p>Should the system be particularly successful, it can be iterated upon to produce
variants which can detect other genes of interest – engineering new cgRNAs is a
relatively simple process, and all it would take to convert our OXA-48 sensing
system to sense another gene is replacing this cgRNA. This modular design could
also see use in other areas such as research, where lengthy and difficult
procedures such as RNA extractions would be made much easier to carry out.</p>
<p>Producing the kit is relatively cheap, as once cultures of cells containing our
system have been established, maintaining them is not particularly expensive. In
addition, taking fluorescence readings can easily be automated to eliminate the
possibility of human error.</p>
