summary: "Throughout our project, we kept a detailed timeline of all the different project ideas we explored and the steps we took to come to our final project idea, a rapid detection method for CRE. We were able to meet with a range of academics and specialists to gain a useful insight in to how to progress with our project and how to apply it to our target audience. Through this discussion we were able to modify our wet lab work as well as work on our human practices. By using social media, we were able to network with a range of iGEM teams and gain advice on the direction we should take with our project as well as share knowledge with each other in order to further progress with our project in a successful manner."

## Initial Brainstorming and Planning

{{< timeline_content >}}

We began by dividing into 3 groups so that we could look at different potential
areas following a Microsoft team meeting where we all met each other
(virtually). We looked into past IGEM projects, use of casein and the production
of alternative dairy products, biosensors, and microplastics.

## Sharing Ideas and Research

{{< timeline_content >}}

In our second teams meeting we discussed the research we found. One of our big
concerns, which lead to the elimination of alternative dairy products as an
idea, were the potential legal and ethical issues relating to a food product.
Following the helpful advice from previous IGEM members we looked more into
different tracks, what particularly interests us and explored what we might want
to focus our project on in a broader sense. From here we found an interest in
environmental field as well as that of diagnostics. Use of GFP was mentioned,
along with plastic biodegradability.

## Catch Up and Progress Meeting

{{< timeline_content >}}

In this meeting we were joined with Dr Christophe Corre and research fellow Emzo
De Los Santos. We discussed GFP in plants as a detection tool for pathogens as a
potential project idea. We also discussed the use of social media in
communication and outreach as well as potential collaborations with societies.
With the current situation in the pandemic, we quickly recognised the importance
of using social media platforms to helps build relationships and connections
across teams and organisations, and how this could help everyone in our
respective projects.

## Our first strong idea

{{< timeline_content >}}

In late March we produced our first strong idea for our project – a product
which could be sprayed onto a surface in a hospital and cause any
disinfectant-resistant bacteria to fluoresce. After discussing this in our
weekly meetings, the idea was liked by the whole team but after researching the
idea, talking with professionals, and discussing our findings, we realised that
this was not a major issue in hospitals when compared to antibiotic resistance.
We also moved from a spray-based to a swab-based approach around this time.

## Detection of CRE and biosensors

{{< timeline_content >}}

After further research from break out groups and speaking to various health
professionals (see our [human practices](/Human_Practices) page for more
information) we came across a [Public Health England report about the concerning
rise in CRE infections](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926563/Framework_of_actions_to_contain_CPE-draft.pdf.

Current detection methods for CRE require a lab and take 4-5 days for a sample
to be processed. This can lead to large outbreaks in hospitals, due to a delay
in results. We decided to think about how we could design a rapid detection
method which would be used by cleaning staff without training, and which would
eliminate the need for a lab. If carbapenem resistant bacteria were present on a
swab, the sample would fluoresce to indicate a positive result.

## Developing our idea on how to detect CRE

{{< timeline_content >}}

We started to plan who we might need to contact, in order to begin designing how
this detection method might work. We contacted microbiologists and specialists
within the University of Warwick to allow us to gain a better understanding of
how to tackle this problem.

## Meeting with Dr Freya Harrison

{{< timeline_content >}}

Dr Harrison is a specialist on carbapenem resistance, who we contacted to learn
about the best ways of targeting these bacteria. We were advised to look at
broad spectrum detection, and the possibility of using specific phages of
peptidoglycan layer tagging. We also learnt a lot about the importance of
looking at the infectious dose, how carbapenem resistance spreads, and issues
surrounding biofilms

## Meeting with Dr Antonia Sagona

{{< timeline_content >}}

Dr Sagona is a phage therapy specialist who we contacted about the possibility
of using phages. We discovered that this would likely be too specific, as we
would only be able to target one strain of carbapenem resistant bacteria. This
would be of limited use in a hospital, due to the wide range of different
carbapenem resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_.

## Identifying our target gene

{{< timeline_content >}}

After reading extensively around the subject of CRE, we came across a gene
called OXA-48, which we decided we would select as our target. This is because
there are not currently any existing methods which can detect this gene either
efficiently or quickly. If this gene was present in a bacterial cell, this would
enable us to identify that the bacterium was resistant to carbapenems. In our
next weekly meeting, we also decided that we wanted to use a CRISPR-based
approach in order to accurately identify the presence of this gene in an
organism.

## Meeting with Dr Richard Hastings

{{< timeline_content >}}

Dr Hastings is the Healthcare Regulatory and Technical Manager at
[Mirius](https://www.mirius.com/), a company producing disinfectants and other
cleaning solutions. He informed us of all the legal restrictions and regulations
surrounding the use of biological products on humans, which was of great
interest to us as it meant we moved away from designing a rapid detection method
to diagnose patients, due to the many logistical difficulties. We instead
decided a way of containing the spread of CRE by targeting reservoirs like sinks
would be more achievable for us, and we would be able to do it more effectively.

## Meetings with Jack Lawrence

{{< timeline_content >}}

We met with Jack Lawrence, a member of the 2018 Warwick iGEM team, to discuss
the use of CRISPR to detect carbapenem resistance. This was an extremely
productive meeting, as we designed the gRNAs we would use to allow the dCas9
protein to bind to our target gene (OXA-48) using NUPACK. Soon after, we had a
second meeting where we designed the plasmids, we wanted to engineer to get this
system working. We made a rough step-by-step plan of how we would achieve this
in the lab. Once the correct parts had been ordered, we were ready to start in
the lab and get the project underway!

## Collaborations and Social Media

{{< timeline_content >}}

From early March we decided to use social media to gain advice and knowledge on
our project idea as well as use it as a platform to network with a range of iGEM
teams globally. From June – August we had virtual meetups to discuss our project
development and ideas with teams such as iGEM KCL , iGEM Mingdao , iGEM
Stonybrook to name a few. We gained useful insights into how to improve our wiki
as well which direction to go in when working on human practices and the type of
individuals we should contact which we acted on. Furthermore, through our social
media pages we were able to be involved in many collaborative projects such as
with McMaster iGEM team in June where we worked with them on an educational song
to iGEM Aix Marseille in September for their emoji project game on Instagram
where we shared details of our project on their social media platforms.
