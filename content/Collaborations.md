## McMaster Canada SynBio Song

{{< timeline_content >}}

iGEM Warwick had the opportunity to be involved in iGEM Mcmaster’s song project
which involved our team members submitting in audio of them singing synthetic
biology lyrics. This was part of a project to create a song which will teach
younger students in an unconventional manner more about biology/Synthetic
Biology and also iGEM.

## UK and Ireland Virtual Meetup

{{< timeline_content >}}

iGEM KCL invited us to attend a virtual meetup with a range of UK and Ireland
iGEM teams in June 2021. This was an informal meetup where we were able to meet
a range of different teams and discuss more about our project ideas and plans.
We presented a short 3 minute video on what our project will be to the teams in
our introduction then attended breakout rooms with different teams to work
together to help each other find solutions to problems arising and to share the
work we have done so far.

## iGEM Dusseldorf Postcard Project

iGEM Warwick participated in the iGEM Dusseldorf postcard project. We created a
postcard to be sent to different iGEM teams which will contain information about
our project. This was a fantastic opportunity to share our project idea with a
range of iGEM teams in a simple but creative manner.

## iGEM Mingdao virtual Meetup

{{< timeline_content >}}

While creating our Collaborative outreach Magazine iGEM Mingdao team submitted
their project information in order for it to be added to our booklet. From
reading about their project we saw similarities with ours such as how we are
both creating detection kits to detect dangerous bacteria’s on the rise.
Therefore iGEM Warwick wanted to learn more about their project , human
practices and wet lab work in particular. iGEM Warwick planned a virtual meeting
with the team where we introduced our projects , shared a video introducing our
project as well discussed the wet lab and human practices work we have done. We
discussed possible problems and solutions such as the idea of working with
bacteriophages and also who to contact for human practices. This meetup was
extremely informative and was a fantastic way to get to know another team
working on a similar project.

## iGEM Manchester Code-a-thon

{{< timeline_content >}}

iGEM Manchester organised a "code-a-thon", where teams all programmed for 24
consecutive hours, in order to make progress on their wikis. There were check-in
meetings every three hours, so we could discuss what we had acheived, and
generally have a chat. It was a great experience, with strong camaraderie
amongst the teams, especially during meetings later into the night.
Additionally, teams were able to help each other out with technical issues, for
example asking if anyone knew how to debug or fix an issue they'd been having.
Since two of our team members already have experience with web design, we were
able to help out, especially with regards to JavaScript, which seemed to be a
new experience for the more traditional iGEM team members of biologists!
