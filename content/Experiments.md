Obtained PAJ-390 and PAJ-379 containing MG1655-Z1 cells from Professor
Jaramillo’s lab Prepared plates with appropriate antibiotics for selection
(spectinomycin for all Z1 cells, chloramphenicol for PAJ-390, kanamycin for
PAJ-379) Plated cells

Induced competence in 390-containing line
Miniprepped both plasmids – in hindsight the method was flawed as our yields were low

{{< timeline_content >}}

First, we plated the SAJ-351 cells which contained the 390 (dCas9) plasmids. We
also miniprepped the 379 (GFP) plasmid and obtained a concentration of 26.8
ng/µl.

No growth from transformants

We tried to transform the SAJ-351 cells with the 379 plasmids on the 23/08/21.
The 379 plasmid contained resistance to kanamycin (Kan), so if the culture grew
on the Kan/Spec/Chlor plate then we would know the transformation had been
successful. Unfortunately, there was no growth, so the transformation was
unsuccessful. However, the culture grew on the control plate without kanamycin,
so the cells were not killed in the procedure and the error lied with either the
transformation procedure, the concentration of the 379 plasmids, the competence
of the cells or the 379 plasmid itself.

Control grew, transformants didn’t - made more competent cells from existing culture but forgot to add antibiotics

{{< timeline_content >}}

On the 25/08/21, we tried the transformation again but received the same
results. As we had carefully followed the procedures for both transformation and
competence, we decided the most likely cause for the lack of growth on the
Kan/Spec/Chlor plate was either the 379 plasmid itself or the concentration of
the 379 plasmids, as it was very low. Therefore, we re-did the 379 plasmid
miniprep and received a concentration of 40.7 ng/µl

{{< centeredImage

    alt="Figure 4" >}}

We also ran a restriction digest on the 379 plasmids to see whether there were
any unexpected results. The results were inconclusive – after running the gel
for an additional 40 minutes on top of the required 40 minutes in the procedure,
there was still no visible ladder. We ran the gel again for another 20 minutes,
but unfortunately the agarose melted which meant we had to try again another
day.

We repeated the restriction digest on 31/08/21 and it appears that it may have
worked as we have somewhat of a visible ladder, but the integrity of the gel was
weak, and it broke easily so we were not convinced of the results and planned to
run it for a third time in the future.

Prepared new liquid culture for miniprep

_02/09/2021_

{{< timeline_content >}}

On the 02/09/21, we again repeated the transformation of the SAJ-351 cells,
using the new miniprep of 379 plasmid. On the same day, we carried out another
miniprep of the 379 plasmids to increase the yield to 242.7 ng/µl as a backup in
case the transformation failed again.

{{< centeredImage
    src="/assets/content/experiments/2.png"
    alt="Figure 6" >}}

However, the transformation was a success, creating a cell line which we called
PAJ! A single colony grew on the Kan/Spec/Chlor plate, meaning it contained the
plasmid with the kanamycin resistance gene. This colony was replated on the
06/09/21 to obtain more of the PAJ cells, so we could use them to prepare liquid
cultures and run different experiments. The success of the transformation meant
we did not need to repeat the restriction digest of the 379 plasmid.

Replated half the transformed colony and used the other half for a liquid culture

Both cultures grew nicely, giving us confirmation that we have double transformed cells
