summary: "2018 Warwick iGEM Ripple’s work can be regarded in several ways as a precursor to CREscent’s - which is why we made an effort to add information to their components. Specifically, the self-terminating gRNA they engineered can be used not only as the inhibitory component they envisioned it as, but also as an activating component."

## Building on what came before

Past Warwick iGEM teams have made extensive use of CRISPR as a detection tool –
while our approach is rather different, particularly in our design usable in
vitro, we nonetheless looked into their components; of these, the 2018 team,
Ripple, caught our attention due to the number of applications they found for
their detection system in assisting the bioremediation of water. One part we
felt like we could add more information to was the [self-cleaving gRNA
BBa_K2841513](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2841513) the
team engineered.
