## Abstract

We aim to develop a CRISPR dcas9 based fast fluorescent detection method system
for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), which will hopefully be
implemented in hospital cleaning routine to prevent CRE a common family of
antibiotic resistant bacteria found in sinks from spreading.
