## Looking forward

At the time of the wiki freeze, the projects have not been judged, nor have the
awards been announced, so this page is empty - for now.

As a team, we've put a huge amount of work into our project, and are genuinely
proud of what we've managed to acheive, despite the limitations of the pandemic
making meeting and collaboration that much harder. We hope that the judges will
be impressed by the quality of work and effort we've put into the project!
